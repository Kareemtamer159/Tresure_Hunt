## 🎮 About The Project
This is a text-based adventure game created as part of **Day 3 of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"** by Dr. Angela Yu.
The player is taken on a short treasure-hunting journey through a series of decisions.  
Each decision affects whether they proceed or lose the game.
